title: Hand made ice cream
---

This is still under development.

While I do recommend to use an ice cream maker, it is possible to make ice cream
without one.

- pour your ice cream mixture into a bowl (preferably aluminium)
- cover with cling film
- freeze for exactly 1 hour
- mix with a rubber spatula for 2 minutes, make sure no crystals have formed
- repeat freezing and mixing at least 4 times (more if not yet creamy)
