The Gaggia Gelateria is an ice cream maker. It can churn approximately 600 ml of
ice cream at a time.

# Parts

The machine itself has a few noteworthy details:

- Timer
- Mixing switch
- Cooling switch

The fixed bowl in the machine can be used as-is, but you can opt to use the
removable bowl instead.

The machine comes with a few parts:

- Mixing blade for the fixed bowl
- Mixing blade for the removable bowl
- Measuring cup
- Removable bowl
- Locking nut for the mixing blades

# Operation

If you have moved the ice cream maker, allow the refrigerant to settle for 12
hours.

Make sure all parts are thoroughly washed.

- Fit the mixing blade in the bowl (or the removable bowl) and tighten the nut
- Press the cooling switch to turn on the cooling function
- Let it pre-freeze for 5 minutes
- Set the timer according to the recipe (20 to 30 minutes)
- Press the mixing switch to activate the mixing function
- Pour in the ice cream mixture, note that the mixture must be cool
- Put on the cover

If the ice cream still seems a little too fluid after churning, continue for a
few more minutes.

If the mixing stops before the timer has run out, the ice cream has reached its
maximum consistency and thus it stopped automatically.

Note that you should not turn off the freezing function during operation. Should
a power failure occur, wait at least 5 minutes before turning it on again.

## Removable bowl

Using the removable bowl takes a few extra steps, to avoid the removable bowl
sticking to the fixed bowl.

- Take the provided measuring cup (~15 ml)
- Fill it with water and pour it into the fixed bowl
- Fill it with alcohol (or any spirit) and pour it in as well
- Fit the removable bowl into the machine
- Fit the mixing blade for the removable bowl and tighten the nut

Now proceed as normal.
