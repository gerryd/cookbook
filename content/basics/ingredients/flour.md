title: Flour

Flour comes in many types and packages. Sometimes the labels are a bit
confusing.

If the package doesn't mention anything, it is safe to assume it is regular
flour, without additives. This is sometimes called "all-purpose flour" or "plain
flour".

Likewise, if a recipe just mentions "flour", it is safe to assume the recipe
calls for plain flour.

Do note that while they look similar, baking powder is something very different
from baking soda.

Some people claim they add salt to their self-rising flour mix, but I'm not a
fan. It is not common, not necessary, and can lead to different results. If
you want to try, the consensus seems to be to use about 2 g of salt per kg of
flour.

# Self-rising flour

Self-rising flour is usually just plain flour with about 3% baking powder mixed
in.

## Examples

As I often find myself looking this up in a hurry when I find myself without
self-rising flour, here are some examples.

- 125 g flour
- 3.75 g baking powder
<!-- -->
- 500 g flour
- 15 g baking powder
<!-- -->
- 750 g flour
- 22.5 g baking powder
<!-- -->
- 1 kg flour
- 30 g baking powder
<!-- -->
- 500 g flour
- 15 g baking powder

# Bread flour

Bread flour typically contains more protein compared to regular, all-purpose
flour. More protein result in better gluten development, improving the texture
of the bread.

Since I don't always have access to proper bread flour, I sometimes have to
make do with all-purpose flour, and I found that adding some vital wheat gluten
yields very acceptable results.

Usually, all-purpose flour contains about 10% protein, while bread flour is
more in the range of 14%. This is different for each flour, so make sure to
check the packaging; or in my case: experiment because there is no label on the
flour at all.

## Examples

The experiments below use vital wheat gluten, with a protein content of 70 to
80%. Again, this will be different for other brands.

For 500 g of bread flour:

- 480 g unlabeled all-purpose flour
- 20 g vital wheat gluten (70-80%)
