As I don't have a rice cooker, but I do have a steam oven, I have been
experimenting with cooking rice properly in the steam oven.

Of course, all of this depends on the kind of rice you are preparing, but as a
general guideline, the below should work and should yield a portion for a single
person.

# Tools

- steam oven-resistant container with enough surface area (i.e. a ceramic oven
tray).

# Ingredients

- 120 ml rice (yes, by volume, not weight; should be approximately 100 g)
- 180 ml water (room temperature)

# Directions

- preheat the steam oven to 100 Â°C
- wash the rice thoroughly, rinse through a sieve
- spread the rice evenly in the tray
- cover with the water
- steam for 20 minutes
- fluff the rice (and check doneness)
- steam for 5 more minutes if not done
