title: Limoncello
---

The recipe is the same for limoncello, mandarinello (with tangerines) or
arancello (with oranges). The result will be approximately 1 l of *cello.

What will happen is that the alcohol will extract the oils from the zest, which
is what will bring the taste. For this to happen, you will need to let it sit
for 7 to 14 days, and shake the jar every other day.

Once you are happy with the result, add a simple sugar syrup and mix.

Make sure the jar and bottle are perfectly clean, else you risk contamination.

# Tools

- 1 l glass storage jar
- 1 l glass bottle

# Ingredients

- depending on the variant:
  - 4 oranges
  - 5 lemons
  - 6 tangerines
- 300 ml 96% alcohol
- 560 ml water
- 480 g sugar

# Directions

- collect the zest from the fruit using a peeler
- make sure to avoid the pith (white part of the peel), as this will make the drink bitter
- pour the alcohol in the jar
- add the zest
- close the jar well, and shake

Now you will need to be patient for 14 days. Store the jar at room temperature
and shielded from sunlight (a cupboard is perfect). Shake the jar every other
day to maximise the oil released from the zest.

When you are happy with the result, it is time to finalise the process.

- add the water and sugar to a pan
- bring it to a boil, or until all the sugar has dissolved (you will notice the syrup turning clear)
- let it cool down to room temperature
- strain the alcohol and zest mixture, pour the result into a glass bottle (you should have ~250 ml of alcohol)
- pour the syrup into the bottle
- shake well to combine
- refrigerate until ice cold

You should be able to store it in a freezer up to an hour or two befor drinking,
to make it even colder. As the drink contains approximately 25% alcohol, it will
somewhat freeze at around -12 Â°C.

# Alternatives

If you don't have 95% alcohol, you can achieve a very acceptable result by using
white wodka instead.

The process is the same, only the ratio is different to compensate for the lower
alcohol volume. I also use less sugar, because I find the taste less sharp.

- 720 ml wodka
- 240 ml water
- 360 g sugar
