# Chocolate mousse

There are many correct ways to make chocolate mousse. This is just one that I
happen to like.

For example, my grandma used the same "25 g chocolate per egg white"-rule, but
she also made a ruban with half the yolks and some granulated sugar and
incorporated the chocolate into that before stirring the whole thing in with the
whites. She did not use any cream.

My mom swears by using only whites and chocolate, no cream or yolks.

Whichever recipe you follow, usually you will get one portion of mousse per egg
white used, so just multiply accordingly.

## Ingredients

- 1 egg white
- 25 g dark (70+%) chocolate (usually, one bar is 25 g)
- 20 ml cream

## Directions

I recommend using a soft spatula for mixing, instead of the traditional whisk.

- melt the chocolate gently (I highly recommend au bain-marie)
- whip the egg whites
- whip the cream (should be quite stiff, not runny)
- pour some (~25%) of the chocolate on the whipped cream and mix gently
- pour the rest of the chocolate in the whites, mix gently
- add the cream to the whites and mix gently until fully combined
- pour into portion-sized cups
