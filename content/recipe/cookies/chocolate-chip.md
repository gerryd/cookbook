title: Chocolate chip cookies
---

This recipe makes approximately 16 cookies (~35g dough per cookie).

The recipe calls for light brown sugar or cassonade; if you feel like it, you
can replace some of that with dark brown sugar. I wouldn't recommend plain white
sugar, though, but in a pinch that will do as well.

For baking, I prefer to use baking paper on a rack.

# Tools

- baking sheet or rack
- baking paper

# Ingredients

- 100 g butter
- 150 g light brown sugar
- 200 g flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- pinch of salt
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp vanilla extract or vanilla flavouring
- 100g chocolate chips (+ extra)

# Directions

- mix the butter and sugar until smooth and creamy
- add the egg and vanilla flavouriung, mix well
- add the flour, baking soda and salt
- mix until everything is incorporated
- knead the chocolate chips through the dough
- cover and put in the fridge overnight (one hour will do if you're in a hurry)
- preheat the oven to 170 Â°C
- split the dough into 16 equal pieces
- shape the pieces into discs and spread them out evenly on a baking sheet
- (optional) press some extra chocolate pieces into each cookie
- bake for 14 (up to 16) minutes until golden brown
- take them out and let them rest (and harden) for a bit before removing
- let them cool on a rack
