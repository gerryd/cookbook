title: Chocolate chip cookies (Annelise's)
---

This is a recipe I got from Annelise, a pastry chef working on the
island of Nevis. She says it's inspired by the standard Hershey's
chocolate cookie recipe, with a few minor tweaks.

A stand mixer works best, but you can definitely mix it by hand as
well.

This recipe makes about 40 cookies (~35g dough per cookie).

# Tools

- baking sheet or rack
- baking paper

# Ingredients

- 340 g chocolate chips
- 300 g flour
- 250 g butter soft but not melted
- 200 g white sugar
- 90 g cup brown sugar
- 2 eggs
- 12 g (2 teaspoons) vanilla essence 
- 5 g (1 teaspoon) salt
- 5 g (1 teaspoon) baking soda

# Directions

- soften the butter (ideally overnight)
- mix both sugars with the softened butter and vanilla essence
- add in the eggs one by one, mix after each egg
- add in the chocolate chips and mix briefly
- sieve the flour together with the baking soda and the salt
- add in the flour and mix for a short while until a dough is formed
- scoop out a spoonsful on a baking tray lined with baking paper

- for extra round cookies, flip a glass upside down over the cookie wen it comes right out of the oven and is still soft, and swirl the cookie around with the glass

- transfer to a airtight container, or freeze
