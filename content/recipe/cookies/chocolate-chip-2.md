title: Chocolate chip cookies (2)
---

This recipe makes approximately 20 cookies (~35g dough per cookie).

The recipe calls for light brown sugar or cassonade; if you feel like it, you
can replace some or all of that by dark brown sugar. I wouldn't recommend
plain white sugar, though, but in a pinch that will do as well.

For baking, I prefer to use baking paper on a rack.

# Tools

- baking sheet or rack
- baking paper

# Ingredients

- 125 g butter
- 200 g (light) brown sugar
- 180 g flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- pinch of salt
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp vanilla extract or vanilla flavouring
- 200g chocolate chips

# Directions

- cut the butter in cubes and let it come to room temperature so it is soft
- mix the butter and sugar (using a spoon is fine)
- add the egg and vanilla flavouring, mix well
- in another bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt
- now combine everything into a uniform dough
- knead the chocolate chips through the dough
- cover and put in the fridge overnight (one hour will do if you're in a hurry)
- preheat the oven to 180 Â°C
- split the dough into 20 equal balls (approximately 35 g)
- lay out the balls on a baking sheet, making sure to leave space as the balls will melt into discs
- (optional) press some extra chocolate pieces into each cookie
- bake for 17 (up to 19) minutes until golden brown
- take them out and let them rest (and harden) for a bit before removing
- if some cookies melted together, cut and separate them
- let them cool down on a rack
