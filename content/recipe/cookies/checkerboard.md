title: Checkerboard cookies
---

This makes very pretty cookies, with a checkerboard-like pattern.
Usually, I will make only four squares, but you can go nuts and go up
to 9 or 16!

# Tools

- baking sheet or rack
- baking paper

## Ingredients

- 280 (150 + 130) g flour
- 150 g butter
- 90 g powdered sugar
- 15 g cocoa powder
- 2 g salt
- 2 eggs

## Directions

- soften the butter (ideally overnight)
- separate the eggs, keep both the yolks and whites
- beat the butter until creamy
- add in the powdered sugar and salt, mix until combined
- add the egg yolks, mix until uniform
- separate the mixture in half
- gradually add 150 g of the flour, knead until combined
- if it gets too hard, continue kneading by hand
- remove the dough from the mixer, and continue with the other half of the mixture
- whisk the cocoa powder with the remaining 130 g of flour
- gradually add the cocoa and flour to the mixture, knead until combined
- if it gets too hard, continue kneading by hand
- place each dough in a bag
- roll out the bagged doughs to equal rectangles, about 1 cm thick
- freeze both for 10 minutes until firm
- whisk the egg whites to loosen them up (do not beat!)
- preheat the oven to 175 °C
- place both doughs on a work surface, brush egg white on both tops and flip them together (using the egg white as a glue)
- trim the edges so you have nice, straight rectangles
- cut into equal strips, make sure these are squared
- use more egg whites to glue two strips together to make the checkerboard pattern
- cut the bars into cookies of equal thickness
- place the cookies on a baking tray lined with baking paper
- bake for 12 to 15 minutes at 175 °C
- transfer to a rack and allow to cool
- store in airtight container, or freeze them
