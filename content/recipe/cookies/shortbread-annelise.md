title: Shortbread butter cookies (Annelise's)
---

This is another recipe I got from Annelise on Nevis. It is by far one
of my favourite simple cookie recipes. They have a nutty, very buttery
flavour and are super simple to make.

# Tools

- baking sheet or rack
- baking paper

# Ingredients

- 250 g butter
- 160 g powdered sugar
- 310 g all purpose flour, do NOT sieve the flour
- 12 g (2 teaspoons) vanilla essence

# Directions

- soften the butter (ideally overnight)
- sieve the powdered sugar if it has lumps
- mix the butter, vanilla and powdered sugar until creamy
- add the flour and mix until a dough is formed
- if the dough looks a little dry add a table spoon of milk and mix it in
- do NOT overmix, we don't want to develop the gluten
- pre-heat the oven to 170 °C
- roll the dough out to a 5 mm thich sheet
- cut into shapes using a cookie cutter
- bake at 180 °C until light brown
- transfer to a rack and allow to cool
- store in airtight container, or freeze them
