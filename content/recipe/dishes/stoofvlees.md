# Directions

- peel the onions and cut them in large chunks

- dry the meat using kitchen paper or similar
- coat the meat with flour (if preparing a lot of meat, only coat half)

- prepare the meat with pepper & salt
- bake the meat until golden brown on the outside (don't fill the pan too much, don't cover the bottom, do it 2x if needed)

- add it to the meat and onions

- crumble in the gingerbread
- put the mustard on the bread and put it mustard side down in the pot
- let it cook on low to medium for 1.5 to 3 hours, without lid
- check regularly if the meat is cooked
- when the sauce has the desired thickness but the meat is not done yet, put on a lid

Serve with a fresh salad and ~1.2 kg of fries.

For a simple "witloof" salad, use 10 witloof, cut in long thin strips. Mix with
4 tablespoons of mayonnaise, a splash of vinegar, pepper and salt.
