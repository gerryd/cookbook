title: Banana bavarois
---

This recipe should be enough for a 24 cm diameter ring, 6 cm high.

It includes a ganache layer between the bottom and the bavarois. I much prefer
it with the ganache, but it works well without.

# Tools

- blender
- baking paper
- sieve
- 24 cm cake ring
- acetate foil (optional, can be substituted by baking paper)

# Bottom

The bottom is a crumbled cookie bottom, held together by butter. It works best
with dry cookies, such as speculoos.

## Ingredients

- 200 g cookies
- 80 g butter

## Directions

- blend of crumble the cookies to a fine-ish powder
- melt the butter
- mix the butter in with the cookie crumbles
- line the bottom of the cake ring with baking paper (sides optional)
- spread the mix evenly over the bottom
- press down with a spoon or another flat tool
- bake for 10 min at 180Â°C

# Ganache

The butter in this recipe is optional, it does give the ganache a nice shine,
but as it is in between other layers I find it doesn't matter much.

## Ingredients

- 180 g dark chocolate
- 180 ml cream
- 20 g butter (optional)

## Directions

- chop the chocolate in small-ish chunks
- warm the cream (do not boil)
- add the chocolate to the warm cream
- stir well until all the chocolate has melted
- optionally, add the butter
- let it cool down slightly
- pour it over the baked bottom
- put in the fridge for 1 hour (or until the ganache has hardened)

# Bavarois

## Ingredients

- 4 ripe bananas
- 5 gelatin leaves
- 4 dl milk
- 4 dl cream
- 120 g sugar
- 4 eggs
- 1 lemon (or lemon juice)

## Directions

- squeeze the lemon, keep the juice
- soak the gelatin leaves for 5 to 7 minutes in cold water
- squeeze the leaves to remove all the water
- boil the milk, turn down the heat and keep warm
- separate the eggs and put the yolks in a bowl
- add the sugar to the egg yolks
- mix "en ruban"
- add some warm milk bit by bit (don't cook the eggs!), stir well each time
- pour the mixture in a pan and heat on low
- continuously mix until it thickens, be careful not to overdo it
- remove from the stove
- add gelatin and mix until it has dissolved
- cut the banana in pieces, and sprinkle with the lemon juice (avoid browning)
- add the banana and the mixture to a blender
- blend for 2 minutes
- (optionally) pour through a sieve
- let it cool down, stir sporadically with a spatula
- when cooled, whip the cream and gently stir it in
- pour on the ganache bottom
- store in the fridge for 4 to 6 hours (or until the bavarois has hardened)
