This is the most basic cake recipe. In French it is called a "quatre-quarts",
which translates to "four-fourths", because the ingredients are made out of four
equal parts.

The quantities below are for a standard rectangular 25x7 cm or 9x3 inch cake
tin. Add 25% for a 30 cm or 12 inch cake tin.

Should you wish, you can also make this into a chocolate cake, and/or top this
with a chocolate ganache.
