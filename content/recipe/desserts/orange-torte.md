title: Orange torte

This orange torte is very moist and is absolutely delicious. It is not overly
orange-y like you would expect. The recipe is for a 22 to 24 cm torte, and will
serve 12.

# Torte

## Ingredients

- 3 oranges (~720 g, you will need 600 g of puree)
- 6 g baking powder
- 6 eggs (~350 g)
- 220 g white sugar
- 300 g almond meal

## directions

- boil the oranges for 10 minutes
- do this two more times (three times total), replacing the water each time
  - alternatively: steam them for 1 hour
- slice and chop the oranges with peel and all, but remove the seeds and the stalk
- preheat the oven to 160 °C
- line your cake pan with baking paper
- add the eggs and sugar to a bowl
- using a mixer, whisk them together
- add the almond meal and baking powder, mix until combined
- purée/blend the oranges until they are almost smooth
- add the orange puree to the mixture, mix until combined
- pour the mixture into the pan
- bake for 60 minutes at 160 °C

# Orange syrup

This probably makes about double of what you actually need, depending on how you
want the torte to turn out. If you have extra, pour the remainder in an ice cube
tray and freeze it to preserve it for about 6 months maximum.

## Ingredients

- 300 g white sugar
- 2 oranges

## directions

- peel the oranges, avoid the white inner peel
- scrape off the white inner peel using a sharp knife
- cut the peels into thin strips
- juice the oranges and filter the juice to remove the pulp
- boil the peels in water for 5 minutes (until they are soft)
- drain the peels
- add the peels, sugar and orange juice to a pan
- heat up and stir until the sugar has dissolved
- continue stirring until it has thickened, about 5 to 10 minutes
- pour as much syrup as you like over the torte
