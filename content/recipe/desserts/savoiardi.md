title: Savoiardi
---

Savoiardi are probably better known as "laydfingers", "lange vingers" or
"boudoirs".

These are perfect for dipping in coffee, though you probably know them best from
tiramisu.

# Ingredients

- 3 eggs
- 90 g extra fine granulated sugar
- 75 g flour
- 15 g cornstarch (maizena)
- pinch of salt
- some more extra fine granulated sugar (for dusting the top)

# Directions

- pre-heat the oven to 180 Â°C
- separate the eggs
- by hand, mix the egg yolks with half of the sugar
- pour all of the whites and salt in a bowl and mix (mixer)
- slowly add in the other half of the sugar
- mix until firm and sugar has dissolved
- use a spatula to slowly incorporate the whites+sugar
- pour the cornstarch and flour through a sieve over the mixture
- use a spatula and mix gently

## Cookies

- use a piping bag with a 1 to 1.5 cm smooth spout
- make "fingers" of approximately 8 cm on a baking tray lined with baking paper
- leave sufficient space as they will expand considerably
- dust with the sugar (use a small sieve)
- bake for 13 to 18 minutes
- let cool down
- if, after cooling, they are still too soft, put them back in for 4 minutes

## Cake layers

These are perfect for tiramisu cake. They will bake into a much softer
consistency than the cookies, but the taste will be very similar.

The quantities in this recipe are enough for two 22 cm layers.

Feel free to dust each layer with extra sugar as you normally would with the
cookies, however I find that it makes it too sweet.

- prepare a baking ring or tin, lined with baking paper
- pour half of the mixture into the ring
- spread out evenly
- bake for 18 minutes
- let cool down
- repeat with the other half
- if you feel they are really too soft, bake them for a few minutes longer
