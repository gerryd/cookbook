Bread pudding, or "bodding", is a wet cake made from bread. This recipe includes
rum, which I highly recommend adding.

# Ingredients

- 100 g dried raisins
- 100 ml rum (be liberal)
- 600 ml milk
- 10 g vanilla sugar
- 400 g bread (can be any kind, even old, I recommend plain white)
- 80 g brown sugar
- extra brown sugar as topping
- 3 eggs
- 3 slices of "peperkoek", "honingkoek", "ontbijtkoek"
- pinch of salt

# Directions

- preheat the oven to 175°C
- soak the raisins in the rum (ideally overnight, cover all raisins with rum)
- in a large pot, heat the milk and vanilla sugar up to ~80°C
- cut the bread in small-ish pieces, including the crust
- in a bowl, combine the brown sugar and the eggs (yolk and whites)
- cut the "peperkoek" and add it as well
- in the raisins and the rum
- put the bread in the pot with warm milk, make a mush
- add the pinch of salt
- add everything together, knead well until homogenous (use a stand mixer)
- grease and flour a bread pan
- pour in the bread mixture
- top off with a layer of brown sugar
- bake for 1 hour at 175°C
