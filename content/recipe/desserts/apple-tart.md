title: Apple tart
---

This recipe will yield a ~27 cm / 10 inch tart.

# Bottom (puff pastry - bladerdeeg)

## Ingredients

- ~250 g puff pastry (store-bought, any kind is fine)

## Directions

- take the dough out of the fridge and bring to room temperature
- take a 27 cm cake pan, grease with butter and dust lightly with flour until covered (remove excess)
- spread out the dough, cover the cake pan and push down into the corners
- remove excess dough with a rolling pin or similar
- stab the dough a few times with a fork


# Filling (custard - banketbakkersroom)

## Ingredients

- 100 ml + 400 ml milk
- 3 egg yolks
- 45 g custard powder (pudding powder - crèmepoeder)
- 125 g granulated sugar
- 1 vanilla pod (vanillestok)
- 2 to 3 apples (slightly sour is better)

Note that you can replace the custard powder by an equal amount of corn starch.
If you skipped the vanilla pod, make sure to add other vanilla flavours.

Also note that if you will use plain gelatin for the finish, you should start
making the finish while the tart is in the oven.

## Directions

- gently whisk 100 ml of milk with the egg yolks
- add custard powder and granulated sugar
- heat 400 ml of milk and the vanilla bean to a boil
- remove from the stove
- temper the custard mixture by gently add a few spoons of the boiling milk and stirring
- gently pour the tempered custard mixture into the milk and slowly bring to a boil
- stir gently but continuously with a spatula
- pour into the cake pan once bubbles are forming
- let cool down
- peel and slice the apples
- arrange them on top of the tart
- preheat the oven to 200 °C
- bake for 45 minutes
- let the tart cool down for a bit on a rack


# Finish

## Ingredients

- 1 bag of Dr. Oetker Taartina
- 200 ml apple juice

## Directions

- mix the Taartina with a few spoons of the apple juice, stir well until dissolved
- heat the apple juice almost to a boil
- remove from the heat and stir in the mixture
- bring back to a boil until bubbles are forming
- pour the mixture evenly over the tart

Or, alternatively, 2 gelatin leaves instead of Taartina:

- soften the gelatin leaves in some water
- heat up a few tablespoons of the apple juice, do not boil
- turn off the heat, add the gelatin leaves
- pour into a container and refrigerate until somewhat thickened (~1.5 hours)
- once you feel confident, pour it evenly over the tart, covering all apples
- refrigerate for 2 hours
