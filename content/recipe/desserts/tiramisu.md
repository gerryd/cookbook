title: Tiramisu

I prefer to make tiramisu in a cake-like shape. Howver, making individual
portions based on this recipe should be trivial.


# Tools

- 22 cm cake ring
- acetate foil


# Bottom and layers

For the bottom, bake two round layers of savoiardi. See the savoiardi recipe for
instructions, and follow the instructions for cake layers.

If you are in a hurry, you can use store bought ladyfingers. The result will be
quite different, though.


# Cream

## Ingredients

- 4 egg yolks
- 110 g sugar
- 500 g mascarpone (room temperature)
- 3 egg whites
- pinch of salt
- 150 ml of liquor (amaretto, marsala, cognac, ...)
- 200 ml espresso
- cocoa powder

## Directions

- mix the yolks and half of the sugar until creamy (~5 minutes, "en ruban")
- add in the mascarpone and mix until smooth
- whip the egg whites with the pinch of salt
- slowly add in the rest of the sugar
- whip until stiff
- mix in the whipped whites with the mascarpone mixture until smooth
- mix the espresso with the liquor
- line the cake ring with the acetate foil
- put one savoiardi layer at the bottom
- evenly coat the savoiardi layer with half of the liquor/espresso mix
- spread out half of the mascarpone mixture on top
- add in the next savoiardi layer
- repeat coating and spreading
- put in the fridge for 4 hours
- dust the top with cocoa powder
