title: Chocolate torte
---

This chocolate torte is very rich, so even though this recipe is for a
22 to 24 cm torte, it will easily serve 12 to 16.

# Ingredients

- 7 large or 8 medium eggs
- 300 g white sugar
- 250 g butter
- 250 g dark chocolate (minimum 65%)
- 5 ml vanilla extract (~1 teaspoon, optional)
- 1.5 ml almond extract (~1/4 teaspoon, optional)
- 30-45 ml rum or whisky (optional)

# Directions

- preheat the oven to 190 Â°C
- melt the chocolate au bain-marie
- melt the butter (microwave is fine)
- line a springform with baking paper (bottom and sides, grease the form to make it stick)
- add the sugar, butter and chocolate to a bowl and mix at low speed
- add the eggs one by one, continue mixing at low speed until combined and shiny
- add the alcohol, vanilla and almond extract (optional)
- pour the mixture into the springform
- bake for 30 to 35 minutes (check after 25 minutes)
- remove from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes
- carefully remove from the spring form

This can be served with strawberries or other red fruit, whipped
cream, banana, powdered sugar or anything you feel goes well with
chocolate.
