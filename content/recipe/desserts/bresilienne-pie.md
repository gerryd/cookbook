title: Bresilienne pie
---

# Tools

- pie pan (~26 cm diameter, ~3 cm high)
- stand mixer with dough hook
- handmixer

While you can use a normal pie pan, I would recommend one with a removable bottom,
to make the process of removing the pie a bit more straightforward.

Note 2022-08-07: I have found that there is probably plenty of dough for a 29
cm pie pan. I also found the dough to rise too much, so after 10 minutes in the
oven, popped the base and weighted it down. I have reduced the amount of dry
yeast from 9 to 7 grams.


# Bottom

## Ingredients

- 420 g flour
- 210 g butter
- 30 g granulated sugar
- 80 ml milk
- 18 g fresh yeast or 7 g dry yeast
- 1 egg
- pinch of salt

The dough will be quite firm; if you have one available, a standmixer with a
dough hook would help.

## Directions

- bring the butter to room temperature
- mix the flour, butter and sugar
- warm the milk to ~50 째C
- add the yeast to the milk and let it sit for a bit (until dissolved or rehydrated)
- when the dough is somewhat mixed, add in the egg and the milk with the yeast
- mix a bit more, take out the dough
- continue kneading by hand until the dough forms a ball
- slightly grease a bowl, put in the dough and cover with a towel or foil
- let the dough rise and rest for 45min in a warm-ish spot


# Pudding

## Ingredients

- 100 ml milk
- 20 g granulated sugar
- 10 g corn starch
- 1 egg yolk
- vanilla flavouring

## Directions

- mix the yolk, sugar and corn starch
- add the vanilla flavouring
- gently heat up the milk until it almost boils
- slowly stir the milk through the mixture
- once mixed, pour everything back in the pan and heat it on medium
- keep on stirring until it thickens
- once thickened, pour the pudding on a plate and cover in foil
- refrigerate until cold


# Flan

## Ingredients

- 475 ml milk
- 65 g granulated sugar
- 65 g flour
- 4 eggs
- 8 g vannilated sugar

## Directions

- take the pudding from earlier
- add it to the mixture and mix well
- let it rest for 15 minutes


# Baking

- heat the oven to 200 째C
- grease the pie pan and dust with flour
- dust your working surface with flour
- knead the dough a bit to loosen it up
- roll out the dough to the shape of your pie pan
- dress the dough in the pan, cut excess dough
- freeze the pan with the dough for 10 minutes
- bake it for 15 minutes at 200 째C
- remove it from the oven, lower the temperature to 175 째C
- pour the flan mixture in the pan with the dough
- bake for 35 minutes
- let it cool down


# Finishing

## Ingredients

- 300 ml cream
- 1 tablespoon powdered sugar
