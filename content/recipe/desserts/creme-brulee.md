- warm the cream over medium heat and mix regularly; do not boil!
- in a bowl, add the egg yolks
- whisk the yolks
- add the sugar to the yolks and whisk lightly (do not make a ruban), work quickly to avoid the sugar burning the yolks
- temper the eggs by pouring in some of the warm cream and mix
- slowly pour in the rest of the warm cream
- let it rest for 20 to 30 minutes, until the foam has cleared up
- preheat the oven to 130 °C
- fill the ramekins with the mixture and place them in the oven dish
- boil some water, fill the tray with boiling water, up to the middle of the ramekins (au bain marie)
- bake for up to 60 minutes (until the cream is set, can still be wobbly in the center)
- let the ramekins cool down and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (up to 48h)
- remove from the refrigerator 1h before serving
- mix the 4 tablespoons of white and brown sugar
- for each ramekin, drizzle over the sugar mix and use the torch until it caramelises
