title: Moelleux
---

This moelleux (also known as fondant au chocolat or lava cake) is relatively
simple to prepare but requires highly precise baking times. The timing in this
recipe is largely dependent on the oven you are using. My preferred method is
to bake it on a lower rack in the oven and, after 12 to 13 minutes, check it
every minute or so by giving the oven a good shove. If the top stops wobbling,
the cakes are ready. In my experience, this usually takes between 12 and 16
minutes. If you feel the sides are done but the top needs some more, use the
broiler for a minute or so.

This recipe yields four moelleux, though this will vary depending on the size
you make them. I use a muffin tin with an 8 cm top diameter and a 6 cm bottom
diameter.

Make sure to line the pan with muffin liners or baking paper cut into squares
and shaped into a cup.
