title: Apple crumble
---

This apple crumble is technically an apple crisp because it contains oats.
If you want to stay true to the title, leave them out (and replace with an
equal amount of flour).

Also it is not a true crumble because it contains almond meal. Again, feel
free to replace that for an equal amount of flour, but you would be missing
out.

Feel free to add cinnamon, however as it is a bit of a controversial
ingredient, I will usually leave it out. I find it works just as well without!

For serving, I recommend adding a good scoop of vanilla ice cream. If you want
to be extra decadent, add a cream-caramel sauce.

This recipe yields a well-filled 20 cm square cake pan, enough for four to six
people.
