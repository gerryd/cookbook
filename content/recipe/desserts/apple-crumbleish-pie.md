title: "Apple crumble-ish pie"
---

This makes a 24cm pie. This may seem modest in size, but it is more than enough
to make 10 portions.

The pie can be latticed, provided your dough is sturdy enough. If not, just make
a full lid and throw it on top of the pie.

This recipe calls for cinnamon. However, if your intended audience does not like
cinnamon, you can try to use some crushed cloves and grated nutmeg.

# Tools

- 24cm springform pan
- baking paper

# Ingredients

- 200 g butter
- 200 g light brown sugar
- 400 g self-rising flour
- 1 egg
- 8 g vanilla sugar (or replace with vanilla extract)
- pinch of salt
- 1.5 kg sour-sweet apples
- 75 g granulated sugar
- 6 g cinnamon (or 3 teaspoons)
- 15 g breadcrumbs (paneermeel)

# Directions

## Dough

- whisk the egg white and yolk, separate half of it for later
- mix butter, brown sugar, flour, half the egg, vanilla sugar and salt
- continue until the dough is solid and separate in 3 equal parts
- let it rest for 20 minutes

## Filling

- peel the apples and cut them in slices
- mix the granulated sugar and cinnamon

## Assembly

- cut some baking paper to the size of your spring form and put it on the bottom
- grease the springform well and dust with flour
- use 1/3rd of the dough to cover the bottom
- user another 1/3rd to cover the edges
- spread the breadcrumbs on the bottom dough (this will absorb the apple's moisture)
- put 50% of the slices in the pan, dust 1/3rd of the cinnamon/sugar mixture
- put in the rest of the slices, and dust the rest of the mixture
- roll out the remaining 1/3rd of the dough to a circle somewhat larger than your pan
- cut into 1cm strips
- dress the strips into lattices over the pie, use the remainder to finish the edges
- put the pie a bit lower than the centre of the oven
- bake for 60 min at 170Â°C (bottom and top heat) until baked and golden brown
- let the pie cool completely before removing from the form
- serve slightly warm and with some ice cream, or serve the next day
