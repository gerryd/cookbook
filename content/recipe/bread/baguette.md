title: Baguette
---

This recipe will make 2 baguettes of approcximately 30 cm.

This recipe can be made with regular white flour, but works just as
well will whole wheat flour. The latter will yield a drier dough.

The baking process calls for moist air in the oven during the first
few minutes. This can be achieved by spraying the pre-heated oven
with water, or by using a pan with boiling water for the first
minutes of the bake.

If you don't have a convection oven, make sure to bake without too
many layers between the heatig elements and the bread.

# Ingredients

- 160 g water
- 3 g dry yeast
- dash of white sugar
- 250 g flour
- 5 g salt

# Directions

- heat up 50% of the water to ~50 °C (warm to the touch)
- gently stir in the yeast and the sugar with the warm water
- wait for 5 minutes
- add the cold water to the mixture and stir gently
- put the flour in a large bowl
- on one edge, make a hole for the salt and cover it
- on the opposite edge, make a well for the yeast/water
- add in the yeast/water
- mix and make sure the liquid has combined with flour before it touches the salt
- when it has formed somewhat of a dough, pour it out on the counter
- knead until homogenous and not too sticky (5 to 10 minutes)
- tuck the dough into a ball
- oil a clean bowl and drop in the ball of dough
- cover and let rest for 40 minutes
- flatten the dough
- make two equal parts and tuck into balls
- cover and let rest on the countertop for 15 minutes
- flatten the balls into disks and tuck into balls again
- cover and let rest on the countertop for 10 minutes
- pre-heat the oven to 230 °C (with a pan of boiling water for steam)
- form the bread (flatten to envelope-sized rectangle, fold 1/3rd in and press, fold over the rest and pinch, roll up)
- cover and let rest on the countertop for 10 minutes
- make cuts in the bread (1 lengthwise or 3 sidewise)
- cover and let rest on the countertop for 10 minutes
- optionally, sprinkle flour on top
- bake for 5 minutes in the middle of the oven
- remove the hot water pan
- continue baking for 15 minutes
