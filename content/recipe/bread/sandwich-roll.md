title: Sandwich roll
---

This recipe will yield 12 sandwich rolls, similar to the ones you would find in
a Belgian or Dutch bakery shop.

They are slightly sweet because of the sugar, if you don't like that, feel free
to leave the sugar out. Note that this will make for less browning on the
outside, so I would highly recommend not skipping the egg yolk wash if you do
this.

These can be stored in an airtight container for about three days.

# Ingredients

- 500 g bread flour (or ~480 g all purpose flour and 20 g vital wheat gluten)
- 285 g milk (whole milk is better)
- 60 g butter
- 10 g sugar
- 9 g salt
- 7 g dry yeast
- 1 egg yolk

# Directions

- melt the butter
- add all ingredients to a large mixing bowl
- knead by hand for 10 to 12 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic
- shape the dough into a ball, cover it, and let it rise for 25 minutes
- split the dough in 12 equal portions (70 to 72 g each)
- shape each portion into a ball, cover, and let them rest for 15 minutes
- flatten each ball into a disk (using a rolling pin helps)
- roll each disk up tightly, pinching the seams to seal, forming a tapered roll shape
- place the rolls on a baking sheet, make sure each roll has about 5 cm to expand on either side
- cover and let them rise for 60 minutes
- preheat the oven to 250 Â°C
- separate the egg yolk from the egg white, add a dash (~1 tablespoon) of milk to the yolk and mix
- using a pastry brush, paint the top of each roll with the egg wash 
- bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are nicely browned
