title: Sandwich
---

This recipe will make 1 loaf of bread. It's relatively quick; the total process
takes between 2 to 4 hours, depending on the temperature of the environment.

This sandwich bread is soft, fluffy and milky. It's great for toasting!

If you want to keep the unbaked bread for longer, you can stop before the second
rise and freeze it with the pan and all. It will need to thaw for about 6 hours.

# Ingredients

- 220 ml water
- 80 ml milk (whole milk is better)
- 55 g butter
- 7 g dry yeast
- 6 g salt
- 430 g flour

# Directions

- bring the butter to room temperature
- heat up the water and milk to ~50 °C (warm to the touch)
- add in the dry yeast and let it activate up for 5 minutes
- add the butter, salt and 100 g of flour
- knead until somewhat incorporated
- repeat until you have used all the flour
- knead for 7 to 10 minutes, until the dough becomes less sticky and passes the windowpane test; sprinkle flour if absolutely necessary
- put the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover and rise for 1 to 2 hours, until doubled in size
- prepare a loaf pan (~21 cm x 12 cm; if you don't have one, try a cake pan) and lightly grease it
- sprinkle flour on the counter, and take out the dough
- punch it down and roll it out (flour your hands and the rolling pin) into a large rectangle (1 cm less wide than your pan)
- roll it up and place it in the loaf pan
- cover and let it rise for 1 hour, until it puffs up about 3 cm above the pan
- preheat the oven to 175 °C
- bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the top is golden brown; cover with aluminium foil if the browning is going too fast (usually ~20 min); the center should be 90 to 95 °C
