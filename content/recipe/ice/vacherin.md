# Vacherin glacé

A "vacherin glacé" is a dessert with meringue, a sorbet of red fruits and milk
(or vanilla) ice cream.

You will need to prepare a batch of "fior di latte gelato" as well as a
raspberry sorbet. I would advise to make these fresh as you assemble the
vacherin, as they will need to be a bit soft so they will spread easily.

## Meringue

The meringue will take a few hours to prepare and cool down completely. I would
advice to do this a day in advance. You can preserve the meringue for 3-4 days
in a dry environment.

### Ingredients

- 4 large or 5 small egg whites
- 200 g ultra fine sugar
- 1 teaspoon of white wine vinegar
- 1/2 tablespoon of corn starch

### Directions

- take the eggs out of the fridge and let them come to room temperature for 15 minutes
- pre-heat the oven to 130 °C
- line a baking sheet with baking paper
- separate the eggs, keep only the egg whites
- whip the egg whites into soft peaks, slowly add in the sugar and keep whipping
- at the very end, add in the vinegar and corn starch
- shape the meringue into two disks on the baking sheet
- bake for 1.5 hours (or until the exterior is dry and has a light crème colour
- leave the oven door ajar and let the meringue cool down completely in the oven
