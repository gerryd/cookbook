# Gelato al caffè

Gelato al caffè or coffee gelato is basically fior di latte with coffee.

## Ingredients

- 225 ml coffee
- 175 g sugar
- 75 g chocolate-covered coffee beans (optional)
- 75 g chocolate chips (optional)

## Directions

- make a very strong batch of 200 ml coffee (tip: use an italian moka pot)
- pour the coffee in a pot with the sugar
- stir, boil and reduce until syrupy
- let the coffee cool down completely
- make a batch of "fior de latte"
- mix in 180 ml of the coffee syrup
- let it rest in the fridge for 6h
- pour the mixture into the ice cream maker
- start churning
- after 20-25 minutes, add in the beans or chocolate chips (optional)
