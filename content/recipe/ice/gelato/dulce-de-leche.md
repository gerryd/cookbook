achieve a very similar result by using "crema mou".


## Dulce de leche

### Ingredients

- 1 can of condensed sweetened milk (~400 g)
- water

### Directions

- boil for 3 hours (2 or 2.5 if you want a more liquid result)


## Crema mou

### Ingredients

- 200 ml cream
- 200 g granulated white sugar
- 1 vanilla pod (or some vanilla extract)

### Directions

- in a saucepan, add the sugar with a good spoon of water
- cook over low heat, but do not ever stir
- when it starts to colour, mix quickly until you have a caramel
- let it cool slightly
- add in the cream little by little and mix well until combined
- put the mixture back on the heat and let it thicken for a few more minutes
