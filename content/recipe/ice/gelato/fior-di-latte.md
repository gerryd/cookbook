title: Fior di latte
---

Fior di latte, or "flower of milk", is the basic recipe for any Italian gelato.
Its flavour comes entirely from the milk and cream used.

# Ingredients

- 500 ml whole milk
- 180 g fresh cream
- 140 g sugar
- 19 g powdered whole milk
- 5 g carob seed flour (optional)

The carob seed flour is optional, but it is used to naturally thicken the ice
cream, making it more creamy and less runny.

# Directions

- pour the milk, sugar and powdered milk into a pot
- mix with a spatula
- heat up to 85 Â°C
- let it cool down
- add the cream and carob seed flour
- blend well using a blender, 3 minutes or untill everything is combined
- put in the fridge for 6 hours
- churn into ice cream
