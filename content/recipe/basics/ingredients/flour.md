title: Flour
---

Flour comes in many types and packages. Sometimes the labels are a bit
confusing.

If the package doesn't mention anything, it is safe to assume it is regular
flour, without additives. This is sometimes called "all-purpose flour" or "plain
flour".

Likewise, if a recipe just mentions "flour", it is safe to assume you the recipe
calls for plain flour.

Do note that while they look similar, baking powder is something very different
than baking soda.

Some people claim they add salt to their self-rising flour mix, but I'm not a
fan. It is not common and not necessary and can lead to different results. If
you want to try, the consensus seems to be to use about 2 g of salt per kg of
flour.

# Self-rising flour

Self-rising flour is usually just plain flour with about 3% baking powder mixed
in.

## Examples

As I often find myself looking this up in a hurry when I find myself without
self-rising flour, here's some examples.

- 125 g flour
- 3.75 g baking powder

- 500 g flour
- 15 g baking powder

- 750 g flour
- 22.5 g baking powder

- 1 kg flour
- 30 g baking powder

- 500 g flour
- 15 g baking powder
